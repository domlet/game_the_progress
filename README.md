# Game the Progress


## Overview

Game the Progress is a web app designed to give teachers a platform to custom build and play game quizzes with multiple players/students. The teacher creates a game, the students log on to the game and play along as a class. The teacher has immediate access to results on specific students and for the whole class. Students have access to their own results at the end of the game. Results are displayed using D3 graphics. Game the Progress creates an engaging environment where learning becomes fun.
